As part of our publication on [epithelium segmentation using deep learning and immunohistochemistry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37257-4) we published our dataset on Zenodo: the [PESO dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/1485967#.XT8F0ugzb8A). The dataset is free to use under the BY-NC-SA Creative Commons license.

## Contents of the dataset

The PESO dataset consists **102 whole-slide images**, split in to in a `training` and `test` part. The total dataset is around 140GB. For the training part, the reference standard is included. This set consists of:

- 62 whole-slide images, exported at a pixel resolution of 0.48mu/pixels.
- 62 Raw color deconvolution masks containing the P63&CK8/18 channel of the color deconvolution operation. These masks mark all regions that are stained by either P63 or CK8/18 in the IHC version of the slides.
- 25 color deconvolution masks (N=25) on which manual annotations have been made. Within these regions, stain and other artifacts have been removed.
- 62 training masks (N=62) that have been used to train the main network of our paper. These masks are generated by a trained U-Net on the corresponding IHC slides.

The test set consists of:

- 40 whole-slide images, exported at a pixel resolution of 0.48mu/pixels.
- 40 xml files containing a total of 160 annotations of regions that are used in the original evaluation.
- 160 png files of 2500x2500 pixels, exported at a pixel resolution of 0.48mu/pixels. Each png file corresponds to one test region.
- 160 padded png files of 3500x3500 pixels of the same test regions.
- A mapping file (csv) describing whether a test region contains cancer or only benign tissue.

## Using the data

All slides are saved in TIFF format and can be opened with a viewer such as [ASAP](https://github.com/computationalpathologygroup/ASAP). To use the images in Python we can use the python binding of ASAP. To do so, make sure that the `<ASAP install directory>/bin` is in your `PYTHONPATH`. Then use the following snippet to extract a patch:

```python
# Import the ASAP module
import multiresolutionimageinterface as mir

# Create a new reader to open files
reader = mir.MultiResolutionImageReader()
image = reader.open('path to image file')

# Get a patch at x=1000, y=12000 (coordinates relative to level 0) at level 2
level = 1
patch = image.getUCharPatch(10000, 12000, 1000, 1000, level)
```

  "description":"Large set of whole-slide-images (WSI) of prostatectomy specimens with various grades of prostate cancer (PCa). More information can be found in the corresponding paper: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37257-4 \n
 \n
The WSIs in this dataset can be viewed using the open-source software ASAP or Open Slide. Due to the large size of the complete dataset, the data has been split up in to multiple archives. \n
 \n
The data from the training set: \n
<ul> \n
<li><b>peso_training_masks.zip</b>: Training masks (N=62) that have been used to train the main network of our paper. These masks are generated by a trained U-Net on the corresponding IHC slides.</li> \n
<li><b>peso_training_masks_corrected.zip</b>: A subset of the color deconvolution masks (N=25) on which manual annotations have been made. Within these regions, stain and other artifacts have been removed.</li> \n
<li><b>peso_training_colordeconvolution.zip: Mask files (N=62) containing the P63&CK8/18 channel of the color deconvolution operation. These masks mark all regions that are stained by either P63 or CK8/18 in the IHC version of the slides.</li> \n
<li><b>peso_training_wsi_{1-6}.zip</b>: Zip files containing the whole slide images of the training set (N=62). Each archive contains 10 slides, excluding the last which contains 12. These images are exported at a pixel resolution of 0.48mu/pixels. \n
</ul>
The data from the test set: \n
<ul> \n
<li><b>peso_testset_regions.zip</b>: Collection of annotation XML files with outlines of the test regions. These can be used to view the test regions in more detail using ASAP.</li> \n
<li><b>peso_testset_png.zip</b>: Export of the test set regions in PNG format (2500x2500 pixels per region).</li> \n
<li><b>peso_testset_png_padded.zip</b>: Export of the test regions in PNG format padded with a 500 pixel wide border (3500x3500 pixels per region). Useful for segmenting pixels at the border of the regions.</li> \n
<li><b>peso_testset_mapping.csv</b>: A csv file mapping files from the test set (numbered 1-160) to regions in the xml files. The csv file also contains the label (benign or cancer) for each region.</li> \n
<li><b>peso_testset_wsi_{1-4}.zip</b>: Zip files containing the whole slide images of the test set (N=40). Each archive contains 10 slides of the test set. These images are exported at a pixel resolution of 0.48mu/pixels.</li> \n
</ul>
This study was financed by a grant from the Dutch Cancer Society (KWF), grant number KUN 2015-7970. \n
