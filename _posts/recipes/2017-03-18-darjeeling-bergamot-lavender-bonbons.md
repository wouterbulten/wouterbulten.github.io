Dark  chocolate [Callebaut 54.5%](https://amzn.to/2BmzCtn) bonbons filled with a milk chocolate ganache. The ganache is infused with Earl Grey darjeeling tea and lavender. These bonbons are a perfect after-dinner treat due to the combination of a black tea filling with the dark shell.

## Ingredients (filling)

- Earl Grey darjeeling tea (or other Earl Grey / black tea)
- Lavender (make sure it can be used for consumption)
- Chocolate 180 grams, milk
- Heavy cream 100 grams
- Butter, unsalted, 25 grams

## Recipe

*Note: This recipe only covers the filling of the bonbons. All my bonbons roughly follow the same steps regarding coloring and making the shell.*

1. Add cream to a saucepan.
2. Add darjeeling tea and lavender. The amount of lavender is by taste, don't overdo it.
3. Slowly heat cream to 70C, let infuse.
4. Strain the cream and pour over chocolate. Discard the lavender as it will be to overpowering to keep in.
5. Let the chocolate stand for a few minutes.
5. Stir the chocolate, creating an emulsion.
6. Add butter.
7. Let cool before filling the bonbons. Make sure that the temperature of the ganache is low enough not to melt the chocolate but still high enough that it flows nicely into the shells.
