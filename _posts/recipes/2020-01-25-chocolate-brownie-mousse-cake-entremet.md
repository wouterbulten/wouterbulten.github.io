An entremet, or mousse cake, is a luxurious treat and a perfect way to end a dinner. It can also be made fully in advance. Generally, an entremet consists of multiple layers where typically the outer layer consists of a mousse and the lowest layer of cake. The entremet is finished with a (mirror) glaze, or in this instance, with a layer of sprayed velvet cocoa butter.

This specific entremet consists of two layers of chocolate brownie as a base, sour Amarena cherries and dark chocolate mousse. As the entremet consists of multiple layers which need to be frozen, this recipe cannot be made in a single day. The following steps need to be done:

- *Day 1*: [Bake and freeze the brownie base.](#brownie)
- *Day 2*: [Create the mousse](#chocolate-mousse) and [assemble the cake](#assemble).
- *Day 3*: [Unmold, spray and serve the cake.](#decorations)

For this recipe some base equipment is required:

- Entremet mold. For this recipe I used a [Silikomart "Saturn" Entremet mold](https://amzn.to/36vqmQx). If you do not wan't to buy a dedicated mold, you can also use a cake tin lined with [acetate foil](https://amzn.to/2GoCokc).
- A cake tin to bake the brownie, the tin should be slightly smaller than entremet mold. Of course, you can also use the entremet mold and cut the brownie to size.
- Fruit filling. We choose to go for sour [Amarena cherries](https://amzn.to/2ux5rQ5) as they complement the richness of the brownie and mousse. Of course, you can substitute this for something else.

## Making the entremet base (the brownie)

The brownie can best be made the day/evening before you want to assemble the cake. A fully frozen brownie base makes filling the entremet mold significantly easier.

### Ingredients
- 155 g butter
- 80 g fine sugar
- 90 g dark caster sugar
- 140 g eggs (whole)
- 70 g flour
- 1 g (coarse sea) salt
- 125 g dark chocolate

### Required materials

- Handmixer or whisk (if done manually)
- Bowl
- Silicon mold, baking mold (anything to bake the brownie in)

### Steps

1. Bring eggs and butter to room temperature. This way ingredients will mix more evenly and you lower the risk of getting lumps in the batter.
1. Pre-heat the oven to 160 &deg;C.
2. Put the butter in a large mixing bowl and whisk until soft.
3. Add the dark caster sugar and whisk/mix until mixture is light and fluffy.
4. Gently add the eggs in batches and whisk until the eggs are fully incorporated into the mixture.
5. Sieve the flour and sea salt, and add to the mixture.  
6. Melt the chocolate (45 &deg;C) over a double-boiler. You can also use a microwave for this step, but be gentle. Add the melted chocolate to the mixture.
7. Put the brownie mixture into the desired mold, this can be either a round cake pan or a silicon mold. For an entremet, you do not want the brownie to be too thick (7-10 mm will do). When you use a silicon mold, make sure that it is proper silicon and can witstand the temperatures of the oven.
8. Place the mold into the oven at 160 &deg;C.
9. Put the tin in the oven for 15-25 minutes, depending on your oven and the size of your tin. The brownie is done when the middle does not 'wobble' when you move the tin, the top has a paper-like crust and the sides are starting to come lose from the tin. You can use a clean wooden skewer to test if the brownie is ready. The cake is ready when the inserted wooden skewer comes out clean from the centre of the cake.
10. Let the brownie cool, and if needed, cut to size.
11. Wrap the brownie in cling-film and store in the freezer overnight.

## Making the chocolate mousse

For the chocolate mousse, please refer to my [cr√®me anglaise based chocolate-mousse](/blog/food/perfect-chocolate-mousse-my-go-to-recipe/). Halve (50%) of that recipe is sufficient for a single entremet.
