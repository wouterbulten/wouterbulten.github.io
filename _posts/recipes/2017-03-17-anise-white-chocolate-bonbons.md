This bonbon flavor started as a experiment but turned out to be really tasty! The combination of white chocolate (I used white Callebaut callets) with the anise seeds is very addictive. 

## Ingredients (filling)

- Anise seeds (few tea spoons, by taste), *note: not star anise*
- Chocolate 180 grams, white
- Heavy cream 100 grams
- Butter, unsalted, 25 grams

## Recipe

*Note: This recipe only covers the filling of the bonbons. All my bonbons roughly follow the same steps regarding coloring and making the shell.*

1. Add cream to a saucepan.
2. Add anise seeds.
3. Slowly heat cream to 70C, let infuse.
4. Optionally strain the creame to remove the seeds. I prefer some seeds to be present in the ganache for a bite and additional anise flavor.
5. Let the chocolate stand for a few minutes.
5. Stir the chocolate, creating an emulsion.
6. Add butter.
7. Let cool before filling the bonbons. Make sure that the temperature of the ganache is low enough not to melt the chocolate but still high enough that it flows nicely into the shells.
