message: "<p>Hi! Fair questions.</p><p>First of all, icons in these use cases shouldn't
  have that much influence on your SEO ranking. They are used to convey extra information
  to the user. In most cases they only represent links of which search engines will
  have no problems parsing.</p><p>There is a case for accessibility though, icons
  can be hard for screen readers to parse for example. You can overcome these problems
  by only combining icons with existing text, adding the &lt;title&gt; attribute (which
  the svg's in the examples have) or making use of screen reader tags.</p>"
