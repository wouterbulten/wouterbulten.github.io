message: "Hello,\r\n\r\nJust installed new smart door bell with camera. I wish to detect specific person standing in front on door bell. Now testing your solution and so far it detects person. Later today I will use your guide to \"train\" it to detect me.\r\n\r\nWhat I am missing is part 3, on how to use this detection in home assistant :).\r\n\r\nLooking from Home Assistant point of view. Automation:\r\n\r\nMotion is detected. Trigger is called that will capture snapshot from the camera and process it. Now how can I return back to automation who persons in image are?\r\n\r\nThank you and best regards,\r\nAndrej"
