message: "Hi Andrej,\r\n\r\nGreat to hear that you liked the tutorial. I indeed haven't had the time to do the last part yet, connecting it to HA. It isn't that hard after motion detection is running. I was planning to send an event through the [REST API of HA](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest/) or maybe send it directly to my NodeRED instance and connect it to a flow. So in the last part of the 'motion-detected' function, you send a POST request to HA with the event. \r\n\r\nFor visualization you can create a new camera object in HA and point it to the image that the software outputs. See the [HA docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/generic/) for this.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps! Regards, Wouter"
