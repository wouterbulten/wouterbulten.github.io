  Hi Peter, no the `user_id` in the code examples are variables and you don't
  have to change it. You have to setup the Telegram integration properly before
  you can use it. Your chat id should be set in `allowed_chat_ids`. Were you
  able to send a message to your phone? You can also check the docs at the HA
  website for more info on configuring the integration:
