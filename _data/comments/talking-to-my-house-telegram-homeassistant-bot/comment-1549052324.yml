message: <p>Hi,<br />i'm running Dr.Zzs "Holiday Lights" (NodeMCU, LED-Strip, controlled
  via HA) in a garden fence with my neighbour. My intention was to allow my neighbour
  to switch the fence light on and off and to change the colors. At the same time
  it was no option for me to open my HA instance to the internet to allow him any
  access...so, i decided to give telegram a try.</p><p>We ended up with a telegram
  chat group, which allows us to turn the fence light on and off and to switch colors.
  For a better usability i'm using the inline-keyboard in telegram which gives you
  clickable buttons for each control.<br />My solution is based on simple automations
  - sorry therefore, but i'm not familiar with coding ;-)</p><p><a href="https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7735d4063c13f22c64ec6a28d1d6ecc6328390033f951c489a5a71e934ada3bc.jpg"
