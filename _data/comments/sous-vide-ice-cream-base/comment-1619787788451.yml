message: "Hi\r\nThanks for the recipe. Have made both the vanilla and chocolate one and they turned out great. Made the vanilla one into popsicles using two different methods: 1. Whipping the spis videâ€™d mixturenand pouring, was great.  2. Loaded in a whipping siphon with N2O and shoook. Unfortunately I shook to much so turned out too airy, but I think both methods could work fine.\r\nWould like to skip the heating in the chocolate version.. microwave and immersion blender could probably do the trick if you get to know the cooking time of your microwave..\r\nBest!"
