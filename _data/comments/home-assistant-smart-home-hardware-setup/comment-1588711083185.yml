message: "Hello Wouter,\r\nI could use some advice to connect an osram smart+ plug to home assistant. Unfortunately my Vera system uses a different type of Zigbee. Reading that you connected that plug to HA, I tried to do the same but so far without success. \r\nCurrently Mosquitto broker 5.1 and Zigbee2mqtt 1.13.0 are running mostly with default configuration but no Zigbee device is detected when I reset it.\r\nWhat am I missing? What were your settings to get the connection working? Any tips about how you proceeded are appreciated.\r\nRegards,\r\nJaap"
