message: "Hi Jaap, unfortunate to hear that you can't get it connected. I have been using the Conbee (with Deconz) for more than two years now for my zigbee devices. While I tested zigbee2mqtt at the start of my HA-adventure, I quickly switched to the Conbee as the platform was a bit more stable at the time. I have no experience with connecting the Osram plug to a zigbee2mqtt system. So, I'm not sure that I can help you with that. I can only recommend you to read up on the page about the plug [here](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/AB3257001NJ.html), but you have probably already done that.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry that I couldn't help you further today. Good luck!"
