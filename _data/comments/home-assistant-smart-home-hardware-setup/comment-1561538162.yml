message: <p>Hey there,</p><p>Could you maybe point me in the right direction of how
  to trigger node red automations from a deconz device. Im using hassio with a conbee
  ii and a Xiaomi Aqara wireless switch. It is all setup on the <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhass.io%3A8ZsTvR9iglQTsl0ytDS0elXtPCM&amp;cuid=3803521"
  rel="nofollow noopener" title="hass.io">hass.io</a> side and it registers as a deconz
  event when i press the button. I just installed the nodered addon but im kinda lost
  on how i would detect that deconz event? or would i connect to the deconz server
  directly? Its all running on the same pi in my case...<br />Any help would be much
  appreciated thanks!</p>
