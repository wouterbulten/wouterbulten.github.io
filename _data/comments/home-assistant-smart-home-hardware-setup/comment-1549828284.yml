message: <p>Hi Woulter, thanks for your quick reply. Actually in this specific case
  it was a matter of "restart the pi", I guess the zigbee2mqtt stick was in a bad
  state somehow which was resolved by the restart. Now it works! :-) The mqtt messages
  are correctly accepted and I have some automation scripts to use the dimmer switches
  as well, even though it is not exactly the same as when the dimmer is directly synced
  to the lamps. I wanted to use the "detour" over hass to help me understand how to
  use hass for automation.</p><p>I am looking forward to reading further posts of
  yours, they are informative to read and written intelligibly - thank you!</p>
