  Hi Luc, That is indeed the easiest way. See also the [deconz
  website](https://phoscon.de/en/support#hue-light-reset). I currently have my
  Hue lights on the Hue bridge, next to the Conbee (to test some things from the
  Hue ecosystem specifically). You can also try the app method (see the deconz
  link) or maybe something like
  [hue-thief](https://github.com/vanviegen/hue-thief) but I don't have
  experience with that, unfortunately.
