message: '<p>Hi Nirual, I think I know what is going on. Just as a disclaimer: I have
  used zigbee2mqtt only for a short while (when it was below 1.0) and have since then
  switched to a Conbee stick in combination with Deconz. Nevertheless, I do think
  that I know what''s going wrong as I had the same problem when I started. This also
  holds for my current setup using Deconz.</p><p>The dimmer switch shows up as a sensor
  because it is event-based and not state-based such as the lights. Your lights have
  a state ("on" or "off") but the dimmer switch doesn''t have a state (it just has
  four buttons). Instead, zigbee2mqtt sends a mqtt event every time a button is pressed.
  In your automations you should be able to create a trigger based on these events.
  That the sensor state is "unavailable" doesn''t really matter as there is no state
  between button presses.</p>'
