message: "Hi Maikel,\r\n\r\nGiven the language of my blog, I will reply in English; let me know if you would like to have a response in Dutch.\r\n\r\n I use Deconz with Home Assistant. Do you mean that you cannot control them in HA? Or not in Deconz? For Deconz you will need to add the lights to a group first, then you can control that group or the individual lights."
