message: "Hi! This post is more of a summary of the devices I use and I don't use the alarm panel function (yet). So I can't say for certain how you could do it. I do however have an idea. I think you can make an automation that triggers a service call on the alarm. For example, look at this snippet from the [HA docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/manual/):\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nautomation:\r\n  - alias: 'Disarm alarm when door unlocked by keypad'\r\n    trigger:\r\n      - platform: state\r\n        entity_id: sensor.front_door_lock_alarm_type\r\n        to: '19'\r\n        # many z-wave locks use Alarm Type 19 for 'Unlocked by Keypad'\r\n    action:\r\n      - service: alarm_control_panel.alarm_disarm\r\n        entity_id: alarm_control_panel.house_alarm\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your case, you will need to change the 'trigger' to something from the switch and probably use a different service. Maybe ` alarm_arm_away` but I'm not sure. That's something you could find out in the services page of your HA install. Good luck!"
