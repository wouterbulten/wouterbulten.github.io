message: "<p>Hi! Thanks for your reply!</p><p>In this case the only way to find out
  is by trying multiple noise vectors. If you have labeled data (which you have with
  MNIST)  you could also train the discriminator to predict both fake/real and the
  label itself. Then you could use that output to see which noise vector results in
  a certain class.</p>"
