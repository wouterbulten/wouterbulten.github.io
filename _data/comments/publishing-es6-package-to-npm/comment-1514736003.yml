message: '<p>Hey, thanks for writing this great article! I have a little question
  regarding this note: "Note: NPM also ignores everything from your .gitignore file,
  so no need to define things twice.". Is that actually the case ? If so, our uploaded
  package won''t have ES6 code (src from npmignore) and ES5 code (lib from gitignore)
  or am I missing something?</p>'
