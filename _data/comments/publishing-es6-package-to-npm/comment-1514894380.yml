message: "<p>Hi! Nicely spotted! It's an error in the article. From the docs:</p><p>&gt;
  Use a .npmignore file to keep stuff out of your package. If there's no .npmignore
  file, but there is a .gitignore file, then npm will ignore the stuff matched by
  the .gitignore file. If you want to include something that is excluded by your .gitignore
  file, you can create an empty .npmignore file to override it.</p><p>In other words,
  the .gitignore is ignored if there is a .npmignore present. In this case, this results
  in the lib directory to be included in the published package, exactly as we want.</p><p>I
  will update the article. Thanks for pointing out the error!</p>"
