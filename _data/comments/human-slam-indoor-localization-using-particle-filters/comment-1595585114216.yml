  thank you, I have placed Beacons in fixed positions and I have noted the
  position in a reference frame so x value and y-value coe coordinates and I
  would like for example find the three raspberries in the room. raspberries are
  mobile and whenever I want to find them in the room I should just run the
  program. just a positioning in the room, and I think the rssi would be of poor
  quality for triangulation. (and I would like to locate several items, but not
  with the fingerprint, it requires too many resources.). Wouldn't the partial
  filter have a good precision here in this case? or do I filter the noise with
  the KF and apply the triangulation?
