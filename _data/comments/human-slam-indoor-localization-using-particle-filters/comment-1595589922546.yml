  Just to make clear: the particle filter I use in the system of this blog post
  also uses RSSI as an input. RSSI is really noisy but with enough filtering
  it's usually doable. I would start with a simple approach and use a Kalman
  Filter and see how far you come. If that's not enough you can look at the more
  elaborate systems. It has been some time I have worked on this, but you can
  find the update rule I used for the beacons in the [Github
  repo](https://github.com/wouterbulten/slacjs/blob/master/src/app/models/particle.js#L84).
