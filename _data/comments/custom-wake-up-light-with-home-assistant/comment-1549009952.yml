message: "<p>Hi Markus, thanks for the suggestion! I'm glad the article helped. I've
  done something similar now for my implementation in Node-RED: I increase the brightness
  manually every minute instead of using a long transition. For some lights (like
  Tradfri) this seems to be more stable.</p><p>Good luck with your implementation!</p>"
