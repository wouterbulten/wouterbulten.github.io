message: <p>Hi,</p><p>thank you very much for the detailed article, found exactly
  the solution i was trying to implement. ;-)</p><p>Just to bring topics together
  - i found this article regarding "Light Fade In" in the HA forums, which follows
  another aproach - for example useful for the Tradfri Lights? - <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.home-assistant.io%2Ft%2Flight-fade-in%2F35509%2F26%3AjOvBIvfz77cFPgl8bcgNWJLdZhM&amp;cuid=3803521"

  using Tradfri lights in two kids rooms, at the moment the automation is triggered
  correctly, but the lights will turn on immediately to the given brightness, the
  transition seems to be ignored. I'll try Frederiks solution via script tonight,
  thanks again!!</p>
