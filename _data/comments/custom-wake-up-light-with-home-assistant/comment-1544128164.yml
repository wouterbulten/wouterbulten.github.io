message: "<p>Thanks for replying. No, I'm not using the brightness neither the color
  temp. I did use your automation and set it up as described. However, the lights
  ain't doing anything. Tried troubleshooting but they just don't seem to react. I
  first try with the group, also tried with one of the two lights but they seem not
  to like turning on. In the Ikea app, you can use them and that works but I'd like
  to use the HA without all the seperate apps.<br />Any idea?</p>"
