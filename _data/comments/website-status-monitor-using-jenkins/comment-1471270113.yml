message: "<p>Thanks!</p><p>I would recommend running your Jenkins installation on
  a different machine (not on the machine that is also running your production website).
  By separating the two you have an independent watcher. Moreover, any errors in your
  build or other resource-intensive Jenkins tasks will not affect your website.</p>"
