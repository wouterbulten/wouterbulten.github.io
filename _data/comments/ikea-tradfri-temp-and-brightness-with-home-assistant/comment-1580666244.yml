message: '<p>Thanks for this post - I am in the process of switching my 15 Tradfri
  bulbs to Hassio/Node red and was going crazy about the fact that i can only change
  one variable at a time! However i am completely new to node red an jso: I have imported
  you snipplet and set up an inject to with the given msg.payload. Upon importing
  it updatet the call service nodes to a new version that apparently handles entity_id
  differently. Now I dont get where i should specify the entity_id? Whatever i do
  the "call service" nodes in the subflow will just say "no connection".</p>'
