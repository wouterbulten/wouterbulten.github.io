message: "<p>Hi! The json message needs to be sent as the msg.payload. If you want
  it dynamic as in the example above (so that the splitting works), you will need
  to set it before you send the message to the subflow. It wil then be split inside
  the subflow and forwarded to the two service calls.</p>"
