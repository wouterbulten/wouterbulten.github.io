  Hi! Unfortunately, I don't use the Ikea app/hub but instead use Deconz with a
  Conbee Zigbee router. So I'm not sure if the room thing from the Tradfri app
  works differently. Technically, this script does nothing more than sending two
  calls shortly after one another. Are you able to update the color temp using a
  service call in HA? If not, then it's not related to the script, but something
  related to the grouping/lights.
