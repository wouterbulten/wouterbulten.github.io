  be specified just in the msg.payload (replacing the "light.some_light_entity").
  What had the sub-flow failing was that when importing the snipplet it also created
  a new Home Assistant server with Woulters settings and was trying to send the call_service
  to that server instead of mine! I had to switch back to my own server in the two
  call_service nodes and now this is working like a charm! (No idea how to get rid
  of the "new server" however - since i desperately imported the snipplet about 10
  times I now have the according number of servers in the list, all called "Home Assistant")</p>'
