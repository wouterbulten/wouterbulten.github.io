message: "Hi Wouter,\r\n\r\nThank you for your script!\r\n\r\nHowever I couldn't get it to set temperature of my IKEA trådfri groups (i.e. \"rooms\"in the trådfri app). It will just adjust brightness in sync, but never color.\r\n\r\nentity: light.living_room #group/room created in trådfri app - only contains bulbs that can do color-temp and brightness\r\ncolor_temp: 333 # swap between 333 and 454 - nothing happens\r\nbrightness_pct: 100 #swap between 1 and 100 - always updates in sync\r\n\r\nDo you have a suggestion of what to look at?"
