message: "<p>Hi Wouter,</p><p>Thanks for the article! We are trying to model an indoor
  location tracking system with BLE (around 20 wall mounted receivers and transmitter
  cards with people walking around the installation). I am trying to wrap my head
  around filtering the stream of data that I will be receiving. For one card and one
  receiver this works quite well. But in my setup one card will ping multiple receivers
  and having multiple cards around means I have a bit of a complicated data stream.
  Can you suggest how to apply the Kalman filter and reduce the noise in this kind
  of a setup</p>"
