message: "<p>In this case, for beacons, there is no control (i.e. they are static)
  so you can ignore u and therefore B. Furthermore, I assume that within the timeframe
  of the measurements the distance between the receiver and sender is constant so
  A is set to an identity matrix. Technically this is, of course, not the case when
  you are moving, but in my experience this is a simplification you can/must make:
  often you do not know anything about the movement.</p><p>As I use RSSI as my observation
  and state, x = z. So, C is, again, an identity matrix.</p><p>To give some context:
  These assumptions and choices are made as part of a larger project on indoor localisation
  of devices. This Kalman filter approach is a first step in that algorithm. A paper
  on this is currently under review so I can't refer you to it (yet).</p>"
