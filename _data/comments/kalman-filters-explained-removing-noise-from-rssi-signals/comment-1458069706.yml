message: "<p>Thanks a lot for such detailed response. My state consists of the RSSI
  value and the rate of change of RSSI. My observations are just the RSSI. So I map
  the state and observation in a linear way. The new state is  linearly linked to
  the previous state. Therefore I believe I should stick to Kalman since the problem
  is suited for Kalman. But I really appreciate your help and comments.</p>"
