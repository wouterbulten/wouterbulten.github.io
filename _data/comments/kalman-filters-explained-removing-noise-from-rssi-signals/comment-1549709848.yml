message: "<p>If I understand this correctly, the Kalman filter on RSSI only works
  if I have multiple measurements at the same distance, right? What happens if the
  client device moves? Then it is unfortunately not possible to determine whether
  the RSSI was affected by a stronger noise or whether the distance has changed, right?</p>"
