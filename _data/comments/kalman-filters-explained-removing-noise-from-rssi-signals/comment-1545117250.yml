message: "<p>Hi Wouter!<br />We are trying to model an indoor positioning system using
  WiFi trilateration. I did find your Java library for a Kalman filter, however I
  am confused about one thing. The WiFi access points will be fixed, however the user
  will be moving. What should be my approach to using the library? Will it work for
  a non-stationary user?</p>"
