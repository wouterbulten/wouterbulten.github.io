message: "<p>Hi,</p><p>In my application, I simplify the problem by making a assumption
  that both are static in the motion model. However, in reality the user is moving.
  Given the high update rate the filter is then (in my experiences) able to pick up
  changes due to movement. Of course, if you have a reliable way of modelling the
  motion than I would incorporate that.</p><p>If you have a static set of measurements
  there could be better alternatives. Like you said, averaging could already work.
  The Kalman filter is a nice online filter that does not need the whole set of measurements
  and targets other use cases.</p>"
