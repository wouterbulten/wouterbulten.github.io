message: "<p>Hello Wouter,</p><p>I have a background in dynamic systems so I understand
  the theory of Kalman filters. However, I still have a question on choosing the measurement
  noise Q.</p><p>A Q can obviously be chosen as the variance of a measurement. However,
  how sure are you that this Q is constant for different distances/RSSI ?If it is
  not, how can one deal with this changing Q ?</p>"
