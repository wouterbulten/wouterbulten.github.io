message: "<p>Hello Wouter,<br />Very very urgent as I will discuss the equations with
  examples in my master's defense.</p><p>I want to know how to use the equations above
  to get filtered values for multiple times.<br />for example: if we have RSSI at
  t=0 equals -70 , RSSI at t=1 equals -65 and RSSI at t=3 equals -60.<br />how can
  we get from the equations above values of filtered RSSI at t=1,2,3? .. .<br />please
  sed me  deriviation to get the filtered values using the equations assuming R=0.008
  and Q=0.1.<br />If you have another example values please provide it urgently.</p>"
