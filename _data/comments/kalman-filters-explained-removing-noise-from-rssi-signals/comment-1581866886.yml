message: "<p>Hi Alex, thanks! I've used R: 0.008 and Q: 4 for tracking a walking user
  through RSSI signals. You could start with that and update accordingly to your own
  findings. You can use u to include a motion model, if you know which direction the
  user is moving. In my setup, I didn't use a motion model because I mainly used the
  filter to smooth the signal before further processing.</p>"
