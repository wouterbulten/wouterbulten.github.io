message: "<p>Hi Fahim! First of all, make sure that you've done the calibration correctly
  (using an average RSSI signal you measure at a 1m distance). In my case the the
  RSSI value at 1m was roughly -62dBm. A change in signal of one dBm, at that level,
  will only result in a small change in distance:</p><p></p><pre><code><br /><br />//Given
  -62dBm as reference value<br /><br />Math.pow(10,(-62 + 62)/ (-10 * 2)) = 1.0m<br
  /><br />Math.pow(10,(-63 + 62)/ (-10 * 2)) = 1.122m<br /><br />//Given -59dBm as
  reference value<br /><br />Math.pow(10,(-62 + 59)/ (-10 * 2)) = 1.41m<br /><br />Math.pow(10,(-63
  + 59)/ (-10 * 2)) = 1.58m<br /><br /></code></pre><p></p><p>Based on these values
  you can notice two things:</p><p>(1) In both cases there is a difference of around
  10-15cm. In my experience, 10cm is far smaller than the precision you can achieve
  using RSSI only. In other words, you can expect these kind of fluctuations as the
  difference in distance is just to small and the effect of random noise and noise
  caused by external sources (people moving around, etc) is high.</p><p>(2) The distance
  predictions differ from your own measurements (-62 at 3m, -63 at 2) which make it
  a bit harder for me to reproduce the 'problem'. This is most likely caused by a
  difference in signal propagation constant that we use (I use 2).</p><p>tl;dr: There
  is a lot of noise, differences in distances at these levels are small. Changes of
  1dBm can be expected.</p>"
