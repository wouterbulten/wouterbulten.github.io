message: "Hi Ryan,\r\n\r\nI would use the raw RSSI as input, then filter it and use the filtered output to convert it to a distance estimate. Most importantly is to set R and Q, which are based on your application and environment.\r\n\r\nIn [this post](https://www.wouterbulten.nl/blog/tech/lightweight-javascript-library-for-noise-filtering/) I have some more practical examples.\r\n\r\nRegards, Wouter"
