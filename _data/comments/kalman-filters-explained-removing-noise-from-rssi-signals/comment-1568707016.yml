message: "<p>It all depends on what you are modelling and how much noise there is
  in the environment. I'm not sure how you end up with multiple values for your standard
  deviation. You can always try to find a value instead of measuring it. The lower
  Q, the faster the system responds to changes (as it trusts the measurement more)
  but the more noisy it is.</p>"
