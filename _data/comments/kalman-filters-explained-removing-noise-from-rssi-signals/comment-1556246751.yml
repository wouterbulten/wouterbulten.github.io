message: "<p>There are a lot of papers in which Kalman filters are implemented to
  estimate RSSI values. As said above, this filter is used for linear systems, and
  the common way to model RSSI is with something like P(d)= -10η log⁡(d/d0 )+A+Xσ.
  How is it possible to implement the Kalman filter and predict values with such a
  good performance even if the input data doesn´t behave as a linear system? Please,
  correct me if I'm wrong. I really want to understand the intuition of the Kalman
  filter.</p>"
