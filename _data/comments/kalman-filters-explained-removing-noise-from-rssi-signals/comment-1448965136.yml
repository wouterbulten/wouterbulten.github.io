message: "<p>The Kalman filter filters the noise based on a weighted average between
  the prediction and measurement, yes.</p><p>As this is a 1D example there are no
  matrices, only scalars. The values for R and Q are in the text (0.008 and signal
  variance) but really depend on your environment. I'm not sure which matrices you
  mean with H and F?</p><p>In general, I tend to use the Kalman filter as a first
  step in a larger processing pipeline.</p>"
