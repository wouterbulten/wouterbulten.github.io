message: "Hi Ala,\r\n\r\nThank you for the comment, and great find regarding this inconsistency! It's been a long time that I have worked on this, but I believe that the code is correct, it should be an addition not a multiplication. I think the plus sign is missing in the manuscript but I will need to double check that later."
