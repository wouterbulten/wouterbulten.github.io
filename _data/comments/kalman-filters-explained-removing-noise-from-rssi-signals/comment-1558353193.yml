message: "<p>Hello Sir Wouter,</p><p>I would like to know the equations used to get
  the filtered values.<br />for example: if we have RSSI at t=0 equals 70 , RSSI at
  t=1 equals 65 and RSSI at t=3 equals 60.<br />how can we get from the equations
  values of filtered RSSI at t=1,2? .. filtered RSSI at t=0 will be 70 for sure.</p>"
