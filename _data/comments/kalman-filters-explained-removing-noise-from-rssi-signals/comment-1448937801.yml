message: "<p>Hi Wouter! I personally am working on ibeacons and have used kalman filters
  as well. But the strange problem that I am facing is this. When I am at  distance
  of 1m from the beacon I get an RSSI value of something like -59dbm , -63 at 2m and
  then when I move away the rssi value might be higher than -63 such as -62. Now Kalman
  can filter out the fluctuation and stabilize the measurements what about the non
  fluctuation problems such as getting -62 db at 3 meters and -63 or lower at 2meters.</p>"
