message: "<p>There is always a trade-off between responsiveness and smoothness. Without
  the filter you have optimal responsiveness but a lot of noise, with a strong filter
  its to slow but really smooth. You could also calibrate your filter by standing
  still, taking measurements, and looking at the variance of the data.</p><p>Thanks
