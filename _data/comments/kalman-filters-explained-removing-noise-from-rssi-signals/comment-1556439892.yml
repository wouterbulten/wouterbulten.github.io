message: <p>Hi Wouter,</p><p>I read an article that proposes to collect the ten recent
  Rssi values of a beacon, calculate mean and standard deviation and use an equation
  based  on the mean and standard deviation to remove outliers. Next calculate a moving
  average of the remaining values and feed that value to the kalman filter.</p><p>Since
  the kalman filter works on data with "random error", do you this method will produce
  "better" results? Or is it even a suitable method?</p>
