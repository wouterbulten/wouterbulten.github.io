message: <p>Hi Kareem, Unfortunately I cannot help you with an implementation for
  your direct use case. You should be able to use the Java version in your android
  app. It is a simple class, you could also use the formula directly.</p><p>I'm not
  sure what kind of data you would like to filter for your restaurant app. Maybe you
  can give some more info?</p><p>Regarding your other questions. Some of these were
  already answered in other comments:</p><p>---<br />"R models the process noise and
  describes how noisy our system internally is. Or, in other words, how much noise
  can we expect from the system itself? As our system is constant we can set this
  to a (very) low value. Q resembles the measurement noise; how much noise is caused
  by our measurements? As we expect that our measurements will contain most of the
  noise, it makes sense to set this parameter to a high number (especially in comparison
  to the process noise)."</p><p>So I would start with a low value for R and a estimate
  Q based on the standard deviation of the RSSI signal. (i.e. measure RSSI at a constant
  distance for a minute or so and use the sd for Q).<br />---</p>
