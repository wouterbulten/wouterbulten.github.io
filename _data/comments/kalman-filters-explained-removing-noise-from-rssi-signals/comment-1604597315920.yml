message: "Dear Wouter,\r\nGreat article for iBeacons and noise filtering. Have to worked on RFID technology with readers and Tags that are deployed in a closed metallic environment? The challenge is how to detect reflection, multipath propagation signals and filter them so that the actual backscattered signal (basically the distance between Tag_1 to Reader)can be filtered? Any real life testing on RFID systems done with algorithms and software that is available to experiment and test? Please let me know.\r\nBR\r\nSsuresh"
