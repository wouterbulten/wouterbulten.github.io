message: "<p>Thanks a lot for your response. Yeah I have calibrated it fine. I took
  multiple values at 1m and averaged them out so i got -59 dBm.  I think the problem
  at I am having is because of the noise in the environment. I initially used n=2
  however the results were pretty erroneous. I personally am right now working on
  using signal processing techniques to filter out the noise and then use the RSSI.
  I did try with Kalman Filter as well but based on what I read online and my personal
  experience, Kalman is acting as a predictor or smoothening mechanism rather than
  filtering out the noise. Can you tell me the matrices you are using for your kalman
  filter? R, Q, H, F?</p>"
