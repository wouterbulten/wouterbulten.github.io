message: <p>Hi Wouter,</p><p>Thank you for the post!</p><p>What I don't understand
  is why Kalman filtering is used on RSSI values for a "stationary" problem. You consider
  that the receiver and the beacon are not moving, so in a perfect world you will
  always measure the same value. I don't see why Kalman filtering should be chosen
  over simpler models for noise removal in this case.</p><p>To calculate an accurate
  distance from different measurements I need exactly one accurate RSSI value. Which
  one do you use? The last kalman prediction from the time series? The average from
  the corrected time series? I found in my experiments that the average of kalman
  filtered rssi values is very close to the average of the raw data.</p>
