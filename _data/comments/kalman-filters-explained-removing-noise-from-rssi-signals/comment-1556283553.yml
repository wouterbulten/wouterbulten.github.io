message: "<p>Hi Jorge, I think it boils down to a matter of simplicity. They way I
  used the kalman filter in my projects is by assuming that there is no movement (within
  the time frame of the measurements). The filtered RSSI was then passed to a (more
  complex) system based on particle filters that also took movement information and
  RSSI measurements of multiple devices in to account. The linear kalman filter was
  primarily used to remove the largest part of the noise.</p><p>Because of this assumption
  I can use the linear Kalman filter, as I assume that the signal between two time
  points should be the same and differences are caused by noise. Of course, in real
  life objects move and this assumption is not 100% valid. However, I found that this
  assumption works fairly well and that the filter wil catch up with the movement.</p>"
