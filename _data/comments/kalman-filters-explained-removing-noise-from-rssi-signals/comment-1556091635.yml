message: <p>Hi Victor,</p><p>Quoting from another comment:</p><p>"R models the process
  noise and describes how noisy our system internally is. Or, in other words, how
  much noise can we expect from the system itself? As our system is constant we can
  set this to a (very) low value. Q resembles the measurement noise; how much noise
  is caused by our measurements? As we expect that our measurements will contain most
  of the noise, it makes sense to set this parameter to a high number (especially
  in comparison to the process noise)."</p><p>So I would start with a low value for
  R and an estimate for Q based on the standard deviation of the RSSI signal. (i.e.
  measure RSSI at a constant distance for a minute or so and use the sd for Q).</p>
