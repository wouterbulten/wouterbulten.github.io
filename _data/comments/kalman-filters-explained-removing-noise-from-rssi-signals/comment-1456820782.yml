message: "<p>Okay thanks for the links, your paper seems very relevant at the moment
  :) <br />To clarify, we use the Kalman filter to smooth the reported distance. And
  seeing as our use cases involve a user that is stationary at some times and moving
  on other, we need to alter the parameters of the filter to allow less noise from
  the process when stationary and substantially more when on the move. This is where
  we put in our signal from the walk detection. <br />We decided against step detection
  as this would only provide an advantage over our current solution given that we
  also have the direction relative to the beacons, which would allow a more detailed
  prediction step, however, this is currently out of our scope for our thesis.</p>"
