message: '<p>Hi! Thanks :)</p><p>It depends on what you would like to measure with
  your walking detector. This blog post was part of my research on indoor localisation
  of devices and users. I used a pedometer to predict movement which gave me a step
  count. Maybe that could also be useful for you? My pedometer uses this Kalman filter
  to filter the accelerometer data.</p><p>An implementation is available through:
