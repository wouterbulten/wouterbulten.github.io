message: <p>How I will found the value of  R and Q or all constant (R, Q, A, B) according
  to my system? Is there any way to find the exact (perfect match value for my system)
  value of these constants?</p><p>"In my scenario I've a beacon and multiple readers.
  Now I want to calculate the coordinate of the beacon on the basic of the reader
  position. But I've found unexpected variation in the RSSI value, so the distance
  calculated  between reader and beacon is also varying. So I want to apply this Kalman
  filter as a solution but I'm confuse with these constants."</p>
