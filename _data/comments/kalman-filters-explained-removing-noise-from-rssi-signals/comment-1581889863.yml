message: "<p>Hi Wouter! Thank you for your recommendations. Right now I am having
  good results with u=0 (since I do not know which direction the user is moving) C=1
  r=.0008 Q=1 A=1 and B=1. I am going to keep experimenting with lower Q values until
  its as responsive as possible.</p><p>Also I am very impressed at your response speed
  and attentiveness to your blog! Thank you for your contributions to the community.</p>"
