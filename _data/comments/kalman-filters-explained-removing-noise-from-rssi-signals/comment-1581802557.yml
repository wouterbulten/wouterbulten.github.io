message: "<p>Hey Wouter,<br />Thank you for posting this! Your research and JS library
  have been a great help to me. I was wondering if you might suggest some values to
  model a human moving at a brisk walking pace linearly through uncontrolled environments.
  For my project I am just trying to smooth the signal so I can see if it is getting
  stronger or weaker with minimal delay and noise. Should I also set z and u variables?</p>"
