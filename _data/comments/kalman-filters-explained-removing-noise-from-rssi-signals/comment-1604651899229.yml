message: "Hi Sandeep,\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't have experience with your use case. I can imagine these distances are quite small? I'm not sure if RSSI measurements will be precise enough. That's something you will need to test. In my experiments for indoor localization I ignored reflections and such, and depended on doing many measurements combined with estimating the positions using the Kalman Filter/SLAM. In your case, given that it is a small environment, this is possibly more critical. I'm sorry that I can't help you further. Good luck with your project!\r\n\r\nRegards, Wouter"
