message: <p>Okay. The difference between a KF and the EKF is the linearity. The regular
  kalman filter assumes that observations are linear functions of the state. Moreover,
  it also assumes that the next state is a linear function of the previous one. This
  is the case in the example of this post. I assume that a RSSI signal is constant
  within the time frame (which is of course a linear transition) and that the observation
  is equal to the state.</p><p>However, most of the time this assumption does not
  hold. In a few weeks I will give a talk at IoTDI 2016 (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fconferences.computer.org%2FIoTDI%2Fprogram.htm%29%3AOGSiGv6UYjX8LGBVy_zQw0hmqjQ&amp;cuid=3803521"

  where I also address this. In my research I used 1D rssi measurements to perform
  indoor localisation. The transition from a coordinate (x,y) of a device to a distance
  estimate is non-linear so I required an EKF for that.</p><p>In your case, you will
  first need to define the following:<br />- What is your state? How do you represent
  it?<br />- What is your observation?<br />- How can you map a state to an observation?<br
  />- How can you map a state to a new state?</p><p>If any of these mappings are non-linear
  you should use an EKF.</p>
