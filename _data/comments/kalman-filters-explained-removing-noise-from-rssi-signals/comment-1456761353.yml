message: "<p>Hi Wouter! <br />Me and my friend are currently working on our Master's
  Thesis and are exploring the uses for indoor localization within mobile applications
  for public transport. We found your library very useful and translated it into java
  as we are building for Android. My question regards tweaking the filter in order
  to use for a non-stationary use case. Currently I've implemented a walking detector
  which returns a binary signal, which in turn determines the process noise of the
  filter in order to account for the increase in measurement variation. Would you
  say that this is a fair approach?</p>"
