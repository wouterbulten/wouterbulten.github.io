message: '<p>Hi Kareem, good to hear that it works now. I don''t think the final keyword
  makes any difference for your use-case as you will use a single filter anyway. I
  do not know all the details of your project so make sure to confirm.</p><p>I would
  recommend this article <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fdocument%2F7471364%3ACjCk-VQLkZ9kFQegOUBJOl7irAM&amp;cuid=3803521"

  for your thesis. This blog post was based on that publication and Section IV has
  more information on RSSI filtering and the formula''s.</p><p>If you (or your university)
  does not have a subscription please contact me on ResearchGate so I can send you
  a private copy: <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fpublication%2F303393596_Human_SLAM_Indoor_Localisation_of_Devices_and_Users%3AJ3UMOfDN_brkJfu15bePOy5OZSU&amp;cuid=3803521"
