message: "<p>Yes and no. You are right that to filter the RSSI you will need more
  than 1 measurement. Usually -- at least in my experience -- the frequency of the
  RSSI measurements is pretty high in comparison to the motion of the user. E.g. you
  could measure the RSSI ten times a second and any movement of the user within that
  second is usually not that large to have a significant effect on the estimated distance.
  So to make single distance estimate it is usually sufficient to do a set of measurements
  within a small time frame.</p>"
