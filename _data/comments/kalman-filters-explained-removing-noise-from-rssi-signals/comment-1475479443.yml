message: <p>Hi!</p><p>These values depend on your system. For RSSI I usually assume
  that most of the noise comes from the measurements. Quoting from my other post:</p><p>"R
  models the process noise and describes how noisy our system internally is. Or, in
  other words, how much noise can we expect from the system itself? As our system
  is constant we can set this to a (very) low value. Q resembles the measurement noise;
  how much noise is caused by our measurements? As we expect that our measurements
  will contain most of the noise, it makes sense to set this parameter to a high number
  (especially in comparison to the process noise)."</p><p>So I would start with a
  low value for R and a estimate Q based on the standard deviation of the RSSI signal.
  (i.e. measure RSSI at a constant distance for a minute or so and use the sd for
  Q).</p><p>A and B are a bit more complex. As your beacons (probably) won't move
  you could start with setting A to an identity matrix. In this post I assume static
  beacons within my measurement time frames and, for convenience, ignore the effect
  of B. If you want to incorporate movement into the system, take a look at my post
  on "human slam":</p><p><a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwouterbulten.nl%2Fblog%2Ftech%2Fiotdi-ic2e-conference-presentation-human-slam%2F%3A9W0rs1hnyophaijh2uyZ605NLJQ&amp;cuid=3803521"
