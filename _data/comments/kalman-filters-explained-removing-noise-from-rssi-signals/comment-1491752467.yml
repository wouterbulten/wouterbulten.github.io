message: "<p>Good question! The variance of the measurements will vary a lot based
  on the environment (e.g. walls). I tend to use one value that roughly captures the
  average variance within my target location. In practice that worked out fine. However,
  this is not ideal and you probably could come up with more intelligent ways to set
  (or continuously update) Q. You could for example track the latest measurements
  and if you detect a larger variance increase Q accordingly.</p>"
