  ? This could be of assistance to you. In the presentation I explain how I applied
  Kalman filters and SLAM to indoor localisation of users inside buildings (while
  holding a phone).</p><p>With regards to your question: Yes, you can use this technique.
  As long as you update frequently the Kalman filter will (slowly) adjust to the moving
  of the user. This is however a tradeoff between use-of-use (and simplicity) versus
  accuracy. If you want to go for optimal accuracy you will have to take movement
  in to account.</p>'
