message: "<p>Hi,</p><p>Did you try out the examples of the article or is there a underlying
  reasoning for your values of A and B? Namely, B models motion and A models transitions
  from t-1 to t. If the values that you set for A and B do not match the system you
  are modelling the values will be extremely off (which can be seen in your examples).</p><p>For
  example: lets say you model the position of a drone. Given no motion a drone will
  slowly fall to the ground. So your A should be negative. However, if you set A to
  a positive value then the model will never be able to correctly capture the real
  events (as the motion model does not match).</p>"
