message: <p>Hello</p><p>My gratitude for the good work. I am trying to use the module
  in node.js environment and have two questions:<br />1. i am getting "not defined"
  error for the randn function. what am i missing?<br />2. what do you mean by dataset?
  a set of measured rssi values i guess. in my module i am measuring rssi and pushing
  the values to an array of say 100 elements. how do i kalman-filter those data?</p><p>Thanks
  in advance</p>
