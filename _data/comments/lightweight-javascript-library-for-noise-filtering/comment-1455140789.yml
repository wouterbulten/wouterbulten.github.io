message: '<p>Hi Scott,</p><p>From what I understand from your description you have
  three scalar values:</p><p>- Acceleration measured by the accelerometer<br />- Velocity
  measured by ??<br />- Position (or height) measured by the altimeter</p><p>Your
  goal is to estimate what the individual true value of these parameters are given
  the noisy sensor measurements. Am I correct? Or are you interested in a single ''position''
  value?</p><p>For the individual parameters you could use a 1D Kalman filter to smooth
  the output of the sensors. You will need a separate filter for each sensor. That
  would be a very easy and computational fast approach.</p><p>If you are more interested
  in a single position value then you can also fuse all the sensors and use the combined
  information in the update step of the filter. See also the example on Wikipedia:
  <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FKalman_filter%23Example_application%3AGkcjmLHAwKC3hiZgYSNRv5U5Vqw&amp;cuid=3803521"
  rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter#Example_application">https://en.wikipedia.org/wi...</a></p><p>Maybe
  it is also good to take in to account that the values are probably correlated. E.g.
  a weather balloon''s acceleration and position are both influenced by wind.</p><p>In
  general: Start by defining your state. What do you want to estimate? i.e. what is
  your x? Start from there and then go forward: how is x updated? etc. (see my other
  post for the definition of the transition model)</p><p>Small note about the lib:
  The library in this post only works for 1D systems, that''s why its so lightweight.
  If you go for a multidimensional approach you should look for another library or
  implement the formula''s yourself. The latter is probably the most efficient option
  (in terms of computation) but will require some more effort.</p>'
