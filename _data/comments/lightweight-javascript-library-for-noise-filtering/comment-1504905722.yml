message: "<p>Thank you. as far as my program goes, i input the algorithm with the
  whole array of measured rssi values, and it returned a new filtered array, which
  is achieved by the .map functionality.<br />By the way do you have any method or
  advice as to how to establish the R and Q values in the real environment, which
  will be a car service in my case. In the blog you mention somewhere that you measured
  the noise but don't explain how.<br />are we supposed to find the correct value
  by trial and error or what?</p><p>Thanks again</p>"
