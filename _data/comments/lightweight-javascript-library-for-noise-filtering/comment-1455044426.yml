  Kalman filters? (See <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwouterbulten.nl%2Fblog%2Ftech%2Fkalman-filters-explained-removing-noise-from-rssi-signals%2F%3A2FGHMCnwZ0pFMjfvffnSGSO-q-o&amp;cuid=3803521"

  ) There I explain more of the background of the technique.</p><p>Regarding your
  specific question: In what way do you want to use the accelerometer for measuring?
  To predict movement and to account for that in your estimation?</p><p>Whether you
  need a 3D system depends on your output. It is totally possible to use 1D Kalman
  filters on your individual channels. If you only want to estimate height, another
  option is to first combine all your sensors and put a filter on the position estimate.</p><p>For
  example: In another project I''ve used an accelerometer as an input for a pedometer
  (to count steps). There I use the 3 axes of the sensor but apply the filter on the
  norm of the acceleration vector, and not on the individual values.</p>'
