message: "<p>I plan to use the filter for a Grove - 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer(Â±1.5g),
  connected via i2c to an Edison SoC. The sensor measures the 3 components of the
  acceleration vector a, namely ax, ay and az respectively.<br />My question is: use
  3 instances of your 1d filter, one for each axis, or look elsewhere for a multidimensional
  implementation?<br />After all, the 3 components of the acceleration vector as measured
  by the sensor describe the one and same phenomenon ...</p>"
