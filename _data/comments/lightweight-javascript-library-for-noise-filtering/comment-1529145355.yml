message: <p>Hi! Currently there is only a Java and python implementation available
  in the contrib folder. See <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwouterbulten%2Fkalmanjs%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fcontrib%3AZeuZZmgtJlzwwJ0uAQ3qxkYC3Bk&amp;cuid=3803521"

  there are other (possibly also C) implementations available online. You could also
  try to implement a C version yourself based on one of the implementations in the
  repo.</p>
