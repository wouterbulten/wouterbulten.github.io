message: "<p>So you just want to record the x,y,z values?</p><p>If you need filtered
  individual values, I think you can use both methods. It is probably fine to just
  perform the filter 3 times, the complexity is low so it shouldn't have that much
  impact. Just make sure that you use a separate filter for each channel.</p><p>You
  can also use a multidimensional filter if you suspect that noise in one axis has
  an effect on the noise of another level (which is probably the case). I'm, however,
  not sure whether the improvement in accuracy (if any) is worth the extra work.</p>"
