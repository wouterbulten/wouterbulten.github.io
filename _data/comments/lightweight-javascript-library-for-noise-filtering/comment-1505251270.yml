message: "<p>Two more and probably the last questions: <br />1. i have a set of rssi
  values and i get a new set by kalman-filtering. now do i calculate the arithmetic
  average to get a single value out of them or what?<br />2. if i have a data set
  of really inconsistent measurements, does applying a sort of data smoothing method
  before applying kalman distorts the functionality of kalman?</p><p>Thanks and my
  best regards</p>"
