message: "<p>Thanks for sharing this library it's been very useful so far although
  I do have a question ...</p><p>I'm using multilateration to calculate the location
  of an aircraft using the time difference of arrival (TDOA) technique but there is
  some variation in the calculated positions (which I'm treating as noise) as well
  as the timesteps between them.  The multilateration process produces a lat,lon pair
  and an HDOP estimate for each aircraft position but these positions are not calculated
  on a regular basis but can be any interval apart, anything from less than one second
  to 5 seconds is not unusual.</p><p>I''m trying to produce a smoothed flight path
  based on these lat, lon pairs and it works rather well but the problem is that the
  Kalman filtered positions consistently lag behind the actual aircraft position acquired
  by observation.</p><p>I'm treating each coordinate (lat and lon) as independant
  of one another (possibly not a valid assumption) with the following parameters:</p><p>R:
  0.01<br />Q: 3<br />A: 1<br />B: 0<br />C: 1<br />u: 0</p><p>I get the best results
  (athough the filtered position lags behind) using the values above.  I've played
  around with changing the value of B (0.05) and u (1) but I simply get a wierd offset
  applied to the filtered position.</p><p>Is there anything that you would recommend
  to reduce the apparent lag ?  I've tweaked most of the values and have found that
  a value of R&lt;1 introduces the delay whilst values &gt; 1 there's almost no delay
  but the result is a lot noisier whilst increasing the value of Q helps smoothness
  but also adds to the delay.</p><p>Would it be worth moving to a 2D version of the
  filter or is my assumption that it's two 1D problems valid ?</p>"
