message: "<p>For GPS data: yes. You could use this to filter longitude/latitude to
  get a smooth signal. Location is 2D (or 3D) though, so a 2D filter could even be
  better as you can take uncertainty of both inputs in to account. If you want a simple
  approach you can just use two 1D filters.</p><p>How you go from GPS to prediction
  of arrival time.. that's more an application question.</p>"
