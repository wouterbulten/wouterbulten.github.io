message: <p>Hi Tarik,</p><p>1. As stated in the article "randn(mean, sd) is a simple
  function that returns random numbers following a Gaussian distribution". This is
  not part of the default JS environment. You can replace it with a normal uniform
  random function if it is just for testing.<br />2. You can just filter the values
  when they come in. The filter does not need the previous values. So just call the
  filter() function for any value that comes in.<br />3. You don't need the length
  of the dataset. The dataSetSize variable in these examples are just used to generate
  some example data.</p>
