message: '<p>Hi Tarik,</p><p>1. The idea of the filter is that you process the values
  one by one as they come in (which will always result in a single number). So normally
  you would do this filtering in an online setting and then just take the last filtered
  value. If you want an example, I implemented this in a indoor localization algorithm/app.
  The part about applying the filter can be found here: <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwouterbulten%2Fslacjs%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fsrc%2Fapp%2Fmodels%2Fsensor.js%23L67%3AARIJ_9sqx8aajGL39RF8VIPmZgw&amp;cuid=3803521"

  The kalman filter is meant to smooth your data. So yes, using another smoothing
  step would probably not help much.</p>'
