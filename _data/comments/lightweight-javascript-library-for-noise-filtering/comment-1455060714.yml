message: "<p>Hi Wouter, thanks for the quick reply. I just read your other article.
  I think I have a pretty good handle on what Kalman filters do, I just don't know
  exactly how best to set mine up. My current thinking is to have the three parameters
  be acceleration, velocity and position. Based on the current state, I can put in
  a model for what the next likely state of those parameters would be. I am using
  the magnitude of the accelerometer, assuming my object is moving in only one direction.
  My impression is that the kalman filter can have inputs measuring two of these parameters
  (position and acceleration), and take into account measurement and system uncertainty
  to give the most likely true position. I basically want to fuse together acceleration
  and height measurements to get a better idea of what the system is doing. Is this
  is reasonable approach?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Scott</p>"
