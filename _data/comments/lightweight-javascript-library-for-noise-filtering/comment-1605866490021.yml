message: "Hi Lahiru,\r\n\r\nThanks! This library is only applicable to 1D streams of data. E.g. a list of RSSI noise measurements. If you need to filter 2D data (e.g. a position) you could look at the Extended Kalman Filter.\r\n\r\nRegarding your other question on Github, I'm not sure what is going wrong for you. If you supply a value to filter() you should get the filtered output back. Note that the first value you supply is not filtered as the filter has no evidence to adjust the measurement."
