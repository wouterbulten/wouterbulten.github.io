message: '<p>Hi Anton!</p><p>You are going in the right direction, filtering is really
  useful when working with RSSI values.</p><p>I wrote a paper on this topic that could
  be of interest to you. See <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fdocument%2F7471364%2F%3AxK8lNryxiHqi42waiIiMokfIqNM&amp;cuid=3803521"

  In this paper I use both Kalman Filters and SLAM to locate beacons.</p><p>To come
  back to your question: Fixing Q is purely convenience. Normally you do not know
  the true noise level in your data (as it is noise) and that''s why you try to estimate
  it as good as possible. In my experiments I measured the noise and used that as
  a value for Q. If, by any means, you have more information about changes in the
  noise level you can of course integrate that in your system. For example, if you
  know that entering a specific room increases the noise level you can increase Q
  and by that tell the system to trust the raw RSSI value less.</p>'
