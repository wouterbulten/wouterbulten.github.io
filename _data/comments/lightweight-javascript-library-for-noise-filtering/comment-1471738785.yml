message: <p>Hi, Wouter!<br />First of all my gratitude for your article!<br />I am
  working on a project for ibeacons detection and distance estimation with Node-RED
  (node js based) language. I can detect beacons and read their data (RSSI particularly).<br
  />I wanted to apply Kalman filtering for the noise cancelation but a bit stuck here.<br
  />Was wondering if you could clarify some points:<br />Do we need to feed the RSSI
  data to the Kalman filter as an array or we can just keep updating the values one-by-one?<br
  />If you have used Node-RED, is it even possible to use Kalman filter in node-red?<br
  />I've tried to use kalman-filter node designed for Node-RED from here <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsyuhei176%2Fnode-red-contrib-kalman%3AIpMYYoYzLJiCmUoFA3SdbjIHe64&amp;cuid=3803521"
  rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://github.com/syuhei176/node-red-contrib-kalman">https://github.com/syuhei17...</a>
  but it didn't work for me <br />Was wondering if you could clarify for me these
  points.</p>
