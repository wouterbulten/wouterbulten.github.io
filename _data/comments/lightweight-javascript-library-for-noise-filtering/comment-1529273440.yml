message: "<p>Hey Wouter!<br />Great work, all your papers are clear and easy to understand
  even for beginners.<br />I read this about 9 months ago, and tried to implement
  it in an indoor position system. <br />However the team decided that a particle
  filter was the way to go. Nowadays, our beacons still transmit noisy RSSI values
  that the particle filter can't compensate. <br />Do you recommend to pass the data
  through the KF before putting the RSSI values into the Particle Filter?.<br />Also,
  what model do you recommend for  RSSI value reading, is predicting growth the way
  to go?<br />Thanks for sharing!!!</p>"
