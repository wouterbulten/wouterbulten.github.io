message: <p>If your movement model is unknown I would disregard A and B, and see if
  increasing R and Q gives you enough to overcome the invalid motion model. If you
  take enough measurements the model will eventually show the correct values. The
  Kalman filter is then primarily used to smooth the values.</p><p>If you know that
  someone is getting closer to a beacon you can try to use negative values for A (depending
  on whether you are measuring meters or RSSI).</p><p>Did you also read my article
  on RSSI filtering? <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wouterbulten.nl%2Fblog%2Ftech%2Fkalman-filters-explained-removing-noise-from-rssi-signals%2F%3A5cPEsMrZ-obaQrQIbMn0-C8bI6M&amp;cuid=3803521"
