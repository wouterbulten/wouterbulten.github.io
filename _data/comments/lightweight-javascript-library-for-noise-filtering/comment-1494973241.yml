message: "<p>Hi Wouter,</p><p>I'm very new to this Beacon technology, and im also
  trying to estimate the distance between a beacon and mobile phone using the RSSI
  value received. Between i came to know that filters are to be used to smoothen the
  received rssi value, here your library comes into handy. But i have some doubts
  like</p><p>var kalmanFilter = new KalmanFilter({R: 0.01, Q: 3});</p><p>I can understand
  the process noise(R) and measurement noise(Q), but why are you fixing the Q value
  to 3. Is it you trying to say that the measured raw rssi value would be plus or
  minus 3 of the original value ?</p><p>Looking forward to your reply</p>"
