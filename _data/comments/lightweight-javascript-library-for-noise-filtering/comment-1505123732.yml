message: <p>Copying from an answer I gave some time a go:</p><p>"Fixing Q is purely
  convenience. Normally you do not know the true noise level in your data (as it is
  noise) and that's why you try to estimate it as good as possible. In my experiments
  I measured the noise and used that as a value for Q. If, by any means, you have
  more information about changes in the noise level you can of course integrate that
  in your system. For example, if you know that entering a specific room increases
  the noise level you can increase Q and by that tell the system to trust the raw
  RSSI value less."</p><p>So, yes, in my experiments I recorded RSSI over time and
  calculated the noise level from that (i.e. the standard deviation of a signal that
  should be constant).</p>
