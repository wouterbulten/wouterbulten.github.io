message: "<p>Hi Sander, thanks!</p><p>Cool application. Would definitely like to hear
  what your outcomes are!</p><p>Regarding Q: R models the process noise and Q the
  measurement noise. The value of these constants depends on your system and the way
  you measure. I assume that most of your noise will be in the system. A drop in the
  amount of available connections will always be caused by a server being unhealthy
  (the process). And not by a fault in measuring (the measurement), right? If so Q
  can be set to a very low value as you will assume that your measurements are correct.</p>"
