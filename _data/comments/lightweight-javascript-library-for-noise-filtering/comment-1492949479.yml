message: <p>Thanks Wouter for the very intuitive tutorial. I am using it to filter
  my strain gauge data. However, I have a DC offset that changes over time. The red
  signal in the figure represents the original signal and the blue one is the filtered
  signal. You can see a overall downward trend that I want to also filter. Any thoughts?<br
