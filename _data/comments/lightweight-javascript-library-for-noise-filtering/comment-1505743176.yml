message: "<p>Hi Tarik, did you by any change were able to read my paper? As that addresses
  locating objects during movement.</p><p>This library is for a 1D kalman filter.
  It works best for static objects, but I also used it for moving objects. If your
  sample rate is large enough you can make the assumption that the device is static
  within a small time frame, because the noise caused by the measurements is usually
  larger than the difference caused by the movement (assuming the object is moving
  slowly, e.g. walking speed).</p><p>For location, however, you cannot use a 1D filter
  alone as distance is at least 2D (x,y) and sometimes 3D (x,y,z) and this implementation
  of the Kalman filter would not be able to represent that. So to come back to your
  question: you can use this Kalman filter in the process of locating a moving object
  but for the actual localization itself you will need something else. An extended
  kalman filter can be used for this, but it depends a bit on your application.</p>"
