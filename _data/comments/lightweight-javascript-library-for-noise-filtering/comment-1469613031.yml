message: "<p>Hi Wouter,</p><p>Nice article! I am trying to find the right mathematical
  approach to 'predict' the amount of connections for a web service in order to find
  out how to scale it accordingly. I am thinking that something like a Kalman Filter
  could help me smoothen out stuff like a server becoming unhealthy and getting replaced,
  temporarily dropping its connections and therefore 'polluting' the data.</p><p>What
  I do not really understand is how to set a correct value for Q. Let's say I have
  1000 connections which drop to near-zero for a brief moment and then come back up
  to 1000, would that mean that I'd set Q to 1000?</p>"
