message: '<p>It depends on your application. For example: I''ve used this type of
  filter and a 3-axis accelerometer to count steps. I first compute the norm of the
  x,y,z values and then apply the filter on this new value. This is more efficient
  than running the filter 3 times.</p><p>See <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwouterbulten%2Fslacjs%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fsrc%2Fapp%2Fdevice%2Fpedometer.js%3ACz6tV4Erp8EeNyGYh93Dyrd2840&amp;cuid=3803521"

  for an example.</p><p>You can also use a 3D version but these are computationally
  more expensive, harder to implement and give only benefit if you actually require
  them for your application.</p><p>Let me know if you need any more help :)</p>'
