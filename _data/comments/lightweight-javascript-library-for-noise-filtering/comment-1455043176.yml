message: "<p>Hi, I am working on a simple system that I measure in two ways. It is
  a system where I am trying to measure the vertical position of an object. I have
  a barometric altimeter (measures height, with noise and drift) and an accelerometer(measures
  acceleration with noise). I would like to combine these measurements into a best
  guess of the vertical position. I think I need a 3d system right? Where I have position,
  velocity and acceleration as my three parameters? Any ideas for other JS libraries
  that could help me with this?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Scott</p>"
