  into the project. Firstly, I want to simulate that the attributes "temperature",
  "humidity" etc. are being passed from one node to its neighbours.<br />The real
  reason why I would use deep learning here is that I plan on doing anomaly/error
  detection. Some data shows 122.323 deg. C which is obviously not a normal room temperature
  and I need to be able to detect this using LNNs :)</p>
