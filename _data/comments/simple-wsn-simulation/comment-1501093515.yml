message: '<p>Hi Wouter!<br />Great work on the SLACTest project. I am also working
  on something similar and I was wondering if there is a way I can modify your original
  project to run it on a terminal in Ubuntu? I mean, I don''t exactly need an animation
  like how you have created (awesome work on that by the way!) but where exactly can
  I make some modifications so that I can "simulate" some "messages" being passed
  through the nodes and it would show the same on the terminal? (for example: "node1:
  message passed to neighbours 2,3,4","node2: message passed to neighbours 1,3,4"...
  and so on). Thanks in advance for your help and great article! :)</p>'
