message: "<p>Thank you for your response. Is it also possible that I can use the project
  (with the above descriptions taken into consideration) to run it in a single, complete
  python script? I wish to not have any dependencies like calling other scripts etc...
  Thanks for the help :)<br />(Please excuse me for my silly questions, the reason
  is that I am trying to run lightweight neural networks on the similar project and
  it would help greatly if everything is in a single script)</p>"
