  Hi,  I'm a beginner at node red and so a bit stuck at the beginning.  I have
  added the code snippets for group and configuration xaml so the dashboard
  shows what you have.   But i'm not sure what i need to do to configure the
  wake up state input node.  It would be useful to see the settings of each node
  for those that a bit new to this.
