message: "Hi Jens,\r\n\r\nThanks for the comment. Based on your comment, I'm not sure yet what is going wrong. Is the output of the function node correct? Maybe you can add a debug node there and see if the output matches what it should be. `msg.payload.ontime` should be somthing like `08:00` (no seconds). You can also test setting a custom msg.payload first, just to see if the schedex node updates correctly. Btw, what version of schedex do you have? \r\n\r\nRegards, Wouter"
