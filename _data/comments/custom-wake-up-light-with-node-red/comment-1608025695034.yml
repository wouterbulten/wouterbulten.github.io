message: "Hi Danwill,\r\n\r\nThe idea is to increment the brightness with '+9' every step. However, you don't want to exceed a value of 250 so that's what the 'min' does. I agree the syntax is a bit difficult to grasp but you can see it like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmin(250, brightness + 9)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes sure the brightness is always within 0 and 250."
