message: "Hi Mehmet, nice additions! Fetching the time from HA seems like a sensible way to go. \r\n\r\nIf I understand you correctly, you want to end with a minimum value, right? Because for color temp you need to have a different range. One way to limit the range would be to do something like (in pseudo code):\r\n\r\n```\r\ncolor_temp = max(40, min(color_temp - 10, 255))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will slowly decrease the color temp from 255 to 40. If at start the color temp is > 255, it will set it to 255. If at some time the new color temp drops down 40, it will use 40 instead. \r\n\r\nI hope that answers your question!"
