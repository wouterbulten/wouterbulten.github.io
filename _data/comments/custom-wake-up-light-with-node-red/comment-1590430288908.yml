message: "Hi,\r\nTotally awesome I was able to find your blog! Great stuff indeed.\r\nI am simply looking for a customizable ramping of the dimming intensity.\r\nI have changed the loop timer to 0.25 seconds and left the max loops at 30. I am controlling Lutron Caseta wireless lights and I normally specify \"birghtness_pct\" rather than \"brightness\" as you have specified.\r\nThe get template node keeps throwing up an error though... \r\n\"Error get-template: Request failed with status code 500\"\r\nAny idea why it's not reporting the value back? \r\nIt actually doesn't seem to matter in any event as it works.\r\nIs there something else I should have in my logic. I am currently a complete programming noob and just trying to get an inject node to ramp brightness. I will tie it into a motion detector soon to raise the intensity slowly at night and normally during the day.\r\nGreat blog!\r\nThanks."
