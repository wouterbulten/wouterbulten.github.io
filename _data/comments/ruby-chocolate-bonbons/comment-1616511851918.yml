message: "Wouter\r\n\r\nThank you so much for getting back to me so quickly.  \r\nYes, your answers did answer my questions.\r\nI am halfway through making these bonbons.  I had some hazelnut paste I'd made a few days ago and have now mixed with some melted ruby chocolate.  Waiting for it to cool and fill the bonbon shells which are also cooling.  I think while I'm waiting I'll mix up spiced raspberry.  I'm thinking about what else might go with ruby chocolate as ganache.  Thinking I'll try lightly roasted papitas and maybe some dried cranberries, maybe a little orange zest.  Who knows?  This chocolate thing is new to me at 72.  I feel like I'm in a chemistry/home ec class.\r\n\r\nThank you again.\r\nBob"
