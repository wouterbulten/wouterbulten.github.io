message: "Hi Bob,\r\n\r\nGood questions. 1) Indeed, you will have to leave a little bit of room to cover the bottom of the bonbon with additional chocolate. 2) For the ganache, you don't need to temper the chocolate. You only need to do that for the shell. \r\n\r\nHope that answers your questions. Regards, Wouter"
