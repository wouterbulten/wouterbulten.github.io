message: "Hi Vince,\r\n\r\nThanks! To start, I'm not a food scientist so I can't give you a definite answer on shelf life. In general, it depends on the filling mostly. If you use cream or butter in the filling, the shelf life is shorter than when using a nut+chocolate filling (like in the example above). \r\n\r\nRegards, Wouter"
