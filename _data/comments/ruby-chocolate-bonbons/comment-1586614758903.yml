  Hi Patrick, thanks for your question. I have used Ruby chocolate from
  Callebaut. You can find it on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2oTnP2S) or through the
  [Callebaut website](https://www.callebaut.com/en-US/products/CHR-R35RB1). The
  temperatures mentioned in the article are the recommend temperatures for that
  chocolate.
