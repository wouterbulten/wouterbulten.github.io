message: "<p>Hi Wouter, thanks for the article. As far as I understand, data augmentation
  does not change the number of samples in the dataset. The image transformations
  are applied to the original image, which is substituted by the augmented versions.
  But, in some cases where we are encountering class imbalance, our goal is to extend
  the existent dataset with new samples.</p>"
