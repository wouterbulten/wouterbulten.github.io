message: "Hi Wouter, thank you very much for sharing.\r\nI am a beginner working on a task of image localization. I am wondering how to update the bounding box (like (x1, x2, y1, y2)) in train_labels accordingly, while using functions like tf.image.random_crop, random_flip_left_right, or random_flip_up_down to the train_images.\r\nThanks."
