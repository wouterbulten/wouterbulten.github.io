message: "<p>Hi Wouter, thanks for writing this article. I have been using tensorflow
  data generators and I have switched to dataset APIs due to their fast processing.
  However, I noticed a difference in performance between the models generated using
  generators and dataset API. I am trying to ensure the data augmentation I am applying
  in both the generators and dataset APIs is similar and I have a question relate
  to that: In tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator, the augmentations are
  applied randomly, like sometimes they are applied on images and sometimes they are
  not. I am wondering if the operations like tf.image.random_flip_left_right and tf.random_rotation
  offer the same behavior (augment the image with some probability) or do they always
  augment all the images?</p>"
