message: "Hi Ingrid,\r\n\r\nNormally you don't want to turn the dataset into a numpy array for training. If you do so you will lose a lot of the performance gains tf.data can offer you. If you really need to get (a part of) the dataset as a numpy array you could do something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndata = list(dataset.take(10).as_numpy_iterator())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe snippet above will return the first 10 elements from the dataset as a list.\r\n\r\nRegards, Wouter"
