  Hey Mr.Bulten, I had the same question about the image augmentation in the
  post not increasing the size of the dataset. But, can we create multiple
  dataset objects for each augmentation type by calling the map function for
  that particular augmentation type. And then merge all the created augmented
  datasets along with the original one by concatenation. Is that a possible way
  to expand the dataset using augmentation?
