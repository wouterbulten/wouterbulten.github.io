message: "Hi Wouter, thank you so much for the tutorial. \r\nHow can I turn the dataset into a numpy array? I need my x_train to be in numpy array to reshape and encode. I tried `dataset = np.array(dataset)`, but it returned an empty object. I've been stuck on this all day and I was wondering if you would know the solution!\r\n\r\nThanks"
