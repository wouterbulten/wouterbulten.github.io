  <h1>Series on Home Automation</h1>

  <p>This post is part of a series of posts on Home Automation. These posts usually cover a part of my own smart home or a project I worked on. I make heavy use of Home Assistant, Node-RED and AppDaemon to control my home; these posts are examples of this.</p>

  <p>Interested in my setup?</p>
